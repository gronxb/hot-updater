Auto-patch bases match what `deploy` chose before the storage engine. `core.findBaseBundleIds` reads the new bundle's Release Catalog scope in one point read and keeps every enabled bundle release whose target app version range intersects the new target (the same fingerprint, in a fingerprint scope), newest release first, each bundle once and older than the new bundle, up to `patch.maxBaseBundles`. Targets such as `1.x`, `*`, or `>=1.2.0 <2` get bases again, a `*` or `1.x` release serves every version it covers, a release on another patch version of the same minor line no longer takes a slot, and a promoted or republished bundle counts from its newest release.

`targetBaseCandidateKey` takes the channel name instead of its id, and its key names the catalog scope and the normalized range. The `base_candidates` aggregate and its gauge writes are gone, so each release change writes up to 16 fewer rows; the checked-in D1, Postgres, and Supabase schemas drop the table.
