Provision API keys through the `apiKeys()` plugin, and let core republish a stored bundle.

- **`core.deploy`:** a deployment may name a bundle the database already holds, as `{ bundleId, release }`. It publishes a new release for that bundle in the release's scope and writes no bundle. A missing bundle refuses with `DatabaseBundleNotFoundError`. `Deployment` is now `BundleDeployment | StoredBundleDeployment`, and admin API protocol 2's `POST /releases` accepts both.
- **`createDatabasePluginApis`:** it is typed by its plugin list, so `createDatabasePluginApis(database, plugins).apiKeys.provision(...)` needs no cast.
- **API key provisioning:** `hot-updater init` for AWS, Cloudflare, Firebase, and Supabase registers the app's client key through the provider's `plugins` (the `apiKeys()` plugin its managed server runs) instead of the database plugin's `models.apiKeys`. The agent scaffold's `provision-api-key.mjs` uses the scaffold's `hotUpdater.plugins.ts` the same way.
