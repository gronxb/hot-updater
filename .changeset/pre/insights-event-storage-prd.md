Replace shared Insights installation storage with canonical events and provider-private indexes for current installation queries. SQL and MongoDB keep nine access fields and fetch full event payloads only for selected results; DynamoDB counts compact scope entries. Custom providers implement `recordEvent({ event })`, `findLatestEvents`, and explicit `countLatestEvents` predicates without lifecycle helpers. Move ancillary event fields into typed `metadata`, reusing Bundle JSON conventions, while preserving SDK requests and Console responses.

This changes the unreleased 1.0.0 initialization and custom database contract from the previous installation-row design. The read-cost fix preserves the canonical-event contract and keeps current-state queries independent of retained event history. Append and index updates are atomic; measured read/write costs are documented.
