## 2. Running the Examples

Test the libraryâ€™s functionality using the provided example applications.

### 1. Navigate to Example

Navigate to the example application directory:

pnpm hot-updater init
```

For a quick and easy setup, Supabase is a good option for hosting and managing OTA updates.

### 3. Run on iOS
```bash
pnpx pod-install
pnpm ios
pnpm start --reset-cache
```

To test Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, run the app in release mode:
```bash
pnpm ios --mode Release
```

### 4. Run on Android
To start the Android example app in development mode:
```bash
pnpm android
pnpm start --reset-cache
```

To test OTA updates on Android:
```bash
pnpm android --mode Release
```
