## Motivation

The existing `CodePush` was limited due to its dependency on Microsoft's `AppCenter`. One significant drawback was the lack of a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which could result in slower bundle downloads in certain countries.

Additionally, while `metro` is widely used as a bundler, new alternatives such as `repack` and `vxrn` have emerged. However, tools like `expo update` and `React Native CodePush` only support `metro`, causing dissatisfaction among developers who need more flexibility.

During the development of this solution, I learned about the discontinuation of `AppCenter`, which further emphasized the urgency of creating a better alternative.

### Key Requirements
1. **Freedom of Deployment**
   The solution should allow deployment to any infrastructure that a company uses, providing maximum flexibility.

2. **Bundler Flexibility**
   The solution must support any bundler, not just `metro`, to meet the diverse needs of developers.

### Implementation Approach
To meet these requirements, i introduced a [Plugin System](../concepts/plugin-system). This system allows deployment anywhere as long as the necessary plugin is available. Similarly, developers can configure the solution to work with any bundler of their choice.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosting**: Full control over your update infrastructure
- **Multi-Platform**: Seamless support for both iOS and Android
- **Web Console**: Intuitive update management interface
- **Version Control**: Robust app versioning with semantic versioning
- **Forced Updates**: Push critical updates when needed
