## Introduction
Re.Pack is a modern bundler for React Native.

The `@hot-updater/repack` plugin is a plugin for the [Re.Pack](https://re-pack.dev/) bundler.

It is used to set the bundle ID (uuidv7) and channel at build time.

If you don't do this, you'll get an error saying there's no bundle ID when running the `hot-updater deploy` command.

## Installation

```package-install
npm install @hot-updater/repack --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js title="rspack.config.mjs"
import { HotUpdaterPlugin } from "@hot-updater/repack";

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new Repack.RepackPlugin(),
    new HotUpdaterPlugin() // [!code ++]
  ],
};
```
