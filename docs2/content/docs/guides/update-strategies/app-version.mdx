title: "App Version Update Strategy"
description: "The App Version strategy lets you target specific native app versions when deploying updates. You specify which app version should receive updates using the `-t` (or `--target-app-version`) option with the `hot-updater deploy` command."

## When to Use It?

- Choose this strategy if you prefer manual control over which app versions receive updates, rather than automatic fingerprint-based compatibility checks.

## Configuration

You can enable this feature by setting the `updateStrategy` option to `appVersion` in your `hot-updater.config.ts` file.

```typescript title="hot-updater.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";

export default defineConfig({
  // ... other configurations
  updateStrategy: "appVersion",
});
```

## Client-Side Configuration with `getUpdateSource`

When using the app version strategy in your React Native application, you need to configure the `getUpdateSource` function with the `updateStrategy` set to `"appVersion"`. This ensures that the client app sends the correct app version when checking for updates.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { HotUpdater, getUpdateSource } from "@hot-updater/react-native";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default HotUpdater.wrap({
  source: getUpdateSource("https://your-update-server.com/api/update-check", {
    updateStrategy: "appVersion", // Configure for app version strategy
  }),
  // ... other options
})(App);
```

The `getUpdateSource` function will automatically construct the correct endpoint URL for the app version strategy:
`GET {baseUrl}/app-version/:platform/:appVersion/:channel/:minBundleId/:bundleId`

## Specifying App Version During Deployment

When using the "App Version" strategy, you must specify the target app version for the update using the `-t` (or `--target-app-version`) option in the `hot-updater deploy` command.

```package-install
npx hot-updater deploy -p <"ios" | "android"> -t "1.x.x"
```

The `-t` option accepts not only single versions but also various range expressions.

## Target App Version Range Expression Table

The following table shows the version range expressions you can use with the `-t` option and their meanings. This table is identical to the Target App Version specification for the `hot-updater deploy` command.

| Range Expression | Who gets the update                                                              |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1.2.3`          | Only devices running the specific binary app store version `1.2.3` of your app   |
| `*`              | Any device configured to consume updates from your CodePush app                  |
| `1.2.x`          | Devices running major version `1`, minor version `2` and any patch version of your app |
| `1.2.3 - 1.2.7`  | Devices running any binary version between `1.2.3` (inclusive) and `1.2.7` (inclusive) |
| `>=1.2.3 <1.2.7` | Devices running any binary version between `1.2.3` (inclusive) and `1.2.7` (exclusive) |
| `1.2`            | Equivalent to `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`                                                   |
| `~1.2.3`         | Equivalent to `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`                                                   |
| `^1.2.3`         | Equivalent to `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`                                                   |

## Endpoint Testing

When using the `appVersion` strategy, the update check endpoint typically follows this format:
`GET /check-update/app-version/:platform/:appVersion/:channel/:minBundleId/:bundleId`

Here's an example of testing this endpoint using `curl`. You'll need to replace `:platform`, `:targetAppVersion`, etc., with actual values.

```bash
curl "https://your-update-endpoint.com/check-update/app-version/ios/1.0.0/production/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
```

-   `:platform`: Specifies the platform, such as `ios` or `android`.
-   `:targetAppVersion`: The current version of the client app. This value is used to determine if the app is eligible for an update.
-   `:channel`: The channel name you want to check for updates (e.g., `default`, `staging`).
-   `:minBundleId`: The minimum bundle ID supported by the client. (If unknown for testing, you can use `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).
-   `:bundleId`: The client's current bundle ID.

This request allows you to verify if an update is available for the specified app version.
