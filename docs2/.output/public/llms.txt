### Get Started

- ["Basic Usage"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/get-started/basic-usage) - "This guide walks you through the essential steps to integrate hot-updater into your React Native project."
- ["Introduction"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/get-started/introduction) - "Self-hostable OTA update solution for React Native apps, alternative to CodePush."

### Guides

- ["Channels"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/guides/channel-management) - "Channels let you manage updates across different environments (development, staging, production) and target specific user groups or separate applications."
- ["Compression Strategy"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/guides/compression) - "Choose a compression format for your bundle distribution."
- ["Console (Rollback & Force Update)"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/guides/console) - "Opens a localhost server based on plugins configured in `hot-updater.config.ts`. For security reasons, only localhost server is supported at the moment."

### Managed-Hosted

- ["AWS S3 Storage + Lambda@Edge Function"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/managed-providers/aws) - "This guide walks you through setting up `hot-updater` with AWS S3 Storage and Lambda@Edge Function in a React Native project. You'll configure the environment, install required packages, and initialize AWS for seamless updates."
- ["Cloudflare Provider"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/managed-providers/cloudflare) - "This guide walks you through setting up `hot-updater` with Cloudflare in a React Native project. You'll configure the environment, install required packages, and initialize Cloudflare for seamless updates."
- ["Firebase Provider"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/managed-providers/firebase) - "This guide walks you through setting up `hot-updater` with Firebase in a React Native project. You'll configure the environment, install required packages, and initialize Firebase for seamless updates."
- ["Supabase Provider"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/managed-providers/supabase) - "This guide walks you through setting up `hot-updater` with Supabase in a React Native project. You'll configure the environment, install required packages, and initialize Supabase for seamless updates."

### Policy

- ["When to Submit Your App for Review"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/policy/app-review) - "`HotUpdater` enables seamless updates to JavaScript (JS) files and assets required by your app, bypassing the app store review process in many cases. However, certain changes, particularly those involving native code (e.g., written in Swift/Objective-C for iOS or Kotlin/Java for Android), require app store review. Below, we outline when you need to submit your app for review and when `HotUpdater` can handle updates independently."
- ["Security"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/policy/security) - "Best practices for protecting plugin tokens and sensitive data"

### React Native API

- ["addEventListener"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/react-native-api/addListener) - "The `addEventListener` function allows you to listen for specific events emitted by the HotUpdater. This is useful for tracking update progress or other events during the update process."
- ["checkForUpdate"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/react-native-api/checkForUpdate) - "The `checkForUpdate` function checks if there is an available update for the app by comparing the current app version and platform with the update server's bundle information."
- ["getChannel"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/react-native-api/getChannel) - "The `HotUpdater.getChannel()` function retrieves the current release channel of the app. This is useful when you want to determine which channel updates are being applied from."
- ["isUpdateDownloaded"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/react-native-api/isUpdateDownloaded) - "Returns whether an update bundle has finished downloading in the current app session and is ready to be applied on reload."
- ["reload"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/react-native-api/reload) - "By default, the `shouldForceUpdate` flag is `false`, the bundle is downloaded but not applied until the user restarts the app."

### Self-Hosted

- ["Self-Hosted Overview"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/self-hosted/overview) - "TODO: Document self-hosted deployment"
- ["Self-Hosted Provider"](https://hot-updater.dev/docs/self-hosted/setup) - "Coming Soon"
