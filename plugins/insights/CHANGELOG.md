## 1.0.0-rc.30

### Patch Changes

- 0c884b7: Show daily observed bundle shares in Release health while retaining its scope totals and moving launch failures to a separate chart tab. Count each reporting installation once on its day's last observed running bundle, preserve previous days, and include built-in and unknown bundles in the denominator. Show gaps without observations, the unfinished current day, app-version filtering, and tooltip counts.

  Insights schema 1.3.0 adds daily observation heads and distribution history. Migrate the server and Console together; history begins after upgrade and is not backfilled. The shared model and HTTP conformance suites cover daily replacement and historical preservation, and the versioned infrastructure guide documents each provider's upgrade.

- 541f0ec: Show how quickly a release spreads after deployment in an Adoption tab of Release health. It charts the chosen release's download reports in each interval from the hour it was deployed, read from the Release ID's UUIDv7 timestamp, and their running total: hourly for 24h, six hours for 7d, and one day for 30d. Choose the release in the tab's Chart bundle list of releases observed in the period, newest deployment first, or with Chart newest bundle; or open View adoption from a bundle's Insights card, which picks the shortest period that covers its deployment. The open Release health tab is kept in the URL, the card stays in place while a new bundle or period loads, and an empty chart offers the period that covers the deployment.

  `getReleaseActivity` takes an optional `intervalMs` of whole hours on a release period read and then returns every series point of that span from the period's start; series points also carry `downloads`. It reads the same hourly counters as before, so no schema change, migration, or write is added. The shared model conformance suite covers the hourly series.

## 1.0.0-rc.29

### Patch Changes

- 80bb792: Attach the latest catalog or artifact HTTP response to existing Insights reports without adding requests or changing launch/failure deduplication. Preserve successful, cached, and failed response text with a bounded body and its original observation timestamp. Console exposes the response from event and installation details and alongside error investigation. No database migration is required.

## 1.0.0-rc.28

### Patch Changes

- b412f41: Collect the original update error message and stack trace in Insights and display them in Console event history. Preserve distinct error messages when deduplicating daily failures, and identify older reports with no recorded cause. Error text is bounded to fit the event payload. Console now compares failure rates with the previous period and groups loaded error reports by their original message, with occurrence-specific stacks, app and SDK versions, installation history, and copyable reports. Raw history loads in bounded, resumable batches with explicit coverage. Existing database schemas remain compatible.

## 1.0.0-rc.21

### Minor Changes

- f185d6d: Insights and API keys ship as their own packages: `@hot-updater/plugin-insights`, with `./server` and `./client`, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys`, with `./server`. `@hot-updater/server` and `@hot-updater/react-native` depend on them: the server re-exports them from `@hot-updater/server/plugins/insights` and `@hot-updater/server/plugins/api-keys`, and the app SDK exports the Insights client from its root, so servers and apps install nothing more.
- 61fcd51: `@hot-updater/server` is the runtime host: its root holds `createHotUpdater`, its types, the handlers and `toNodeHandler`, and its other entries are the built-in adapters (`./adapters/*`) and plugins (`./plugins/insights`, `./plugins/api-keys`). The storage engine, the database adapter kit, and core's schema move to `@hot-updater/plugin-core`, the kit adapters and plugins build on, and test code moves to `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
  - `@hot-updater/server/database`, `@hot-updater/server/node`, `@hot-updater/server/plugins`, and `@hot-updater/server/plugins/insights/testing` are removed:
    - Import from `@hot-updater/plugin-core` what you imported from `@hot-updater/server/database` or `@hot-updater/server/plugins`.
    - Import `toNodeHandler` from `@hot-updater/server`.
    - Import the Insights suites from `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
  - From `@hot-updater/server/db`:
    - `createMeasuredDatabase`, `MeasuredDatabase`, and `MeasuredDatabaseOptions` move to `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
    - `targetBaseCandidateKey` and `EngineSqlOptions` move to `@hot-updater/plugin-core`, beside `parseBaseCandidateKey`.
    - `settingsStatements` is private.
  - `createEngine` now has the signature `createEngine(database, { plugins, now })`. It takes a database as `createEngineDatabase` returns it, and returns `{ core, database(plugin), flush, dispose }`. rc.18's `createEngine({ adapter, schema, maxPageSize, verify, retry })` from `@hot-updater/server/database` is gone. A transaction's retries are the database's `retry` (`createEngineDatabase({ retry })`), and verify mode is `verifyAdapter(adapter)`.
  - These rc.18 names now exist in no package, because they are the storage engine's internals:
    - `aggregateBatchingModule`, `CheckIndex`, `checkSchemaFence`, `classifySqlError`, `CliFor`, `compareTuples`, `createDatabaseEngine`;
    - `DATABASE_MAX_MULTI_VALUES`, `DATABASE_MAX_QUERY_LIMIT`, `DatabaseEngine`, `DatabaseEngineOptions`, `DatabaseTestState`, `DatabaseValueError`;
    - `ENGINE_SCHEMA_KEY`, `ENGINE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `InstanceFor`, `isMissingSchemaError`, `MAX_SHARDS`, `migrateSchema`, `normalizeStoredValue`;
    - `ReadRange`, `ResolvedReference`, `resolveSchema`, `SchemaModule`, `settingsStatements`, `SHARD_COLUMN`, `validateSchema`, `withSchemaFence`.
  - No package has an internal entry: `@hot-updater/plugin-core/internal`, `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/internal`, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys/internal` are removed, and `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/testing` too. A package uses another only through its public API. `InsightsBadRequestError`, which Insights' API throws for an input it refuses, is exported from `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/server`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-core` exports `createEngine(database, { plugins, now })`, the storage engine as `createHotUpdater` runs it: core's tables and the plugins', the plugins' settings rows behind the schema fence, expired rows pruned during writes, and batched aggregates. `meterReads(database)` meters any database on the engine, a provider's included, for adapter cost analysis. `database.measureReads(read)` reports what a call read at the adapter and at the engine. Aggregate batching's compaction and flush reads during the call count.
  - An `EngineDatabase` takes an optional `retry`, which `createEngineDatabase` also takes: how a transaction that conflicts with another write runs again, with `onRetry` to observe each rerun. A store many writers contend on can take more attempts.
  - `MemoryAdapterOptions` keeps only `tablePrefix`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-core` also exports what an adapter, a provider's tooling, or a plugin outside it needs: `SETTINGS_TABLE`, `aggregateBatchingTables`, and `encodeKvKey` for setups and access policies; `createEngineSqlMigrator`, `createSettingsMigrator`, `sqlTableShapes`, and `quoteSql` for ORM adapters; `DATABASE_VERSION_COLUMN`, `rowKey`, `findPhysicalIndex`, and `findPhysicalColumn` for an adapter that is neither SQL nor key-value; `compareUtf8` and `isDatabaseJsonObject` for plugins; the types `verifyAdapter` returns and throws; and the option and tooling types of its public functions. `createEngineDatabase` takes `readSettings` for an adapter that reads stored settings itself.
  - `CoreSchema`, core's tables as `createEngine`'s `core` handle types them, is part of `@hot-updater/plugin-core`'s API: a change to core's schema releases `@hot-updater/plugin-core` and ships with the migration `schema.core` versions.
  - `@hot-updater/test-utils` uses the other packages only through their public API. `createMeasuredDatabase(adapter, plugins, { now, storage })` returns a promise of core, the plugins' APIs, their `clientAuth`, and `measureReads`, from `createHotUpdater` over `meterReads({ name, adapter: verifyAdapter(adapter) })`; `now` is the plugins' clock. `setupReadBudgetTestSuite` takes no `server`, and its `createAdapter` gets `SETTINGS_TABLE` among its `tables`. `createPluginTestHarness` and `setupAggregateBatchingTestSuite` run on `createEngine` and take no `engine`; the harness runs no retention passes. It also exports `createMemoryKeyValueStore`, the database fixtures, and the Insights suites, and `@hot-updater/test-utils/node` the SQL test executors and `createD1TestDatabase(db, statements)`, a D1 database over `node:sqlite`. `@hot-updater/server` and `@hot-updater/plugin-insights` are optional peer dependencies.
  - Published packages leave out specs and test helpers:
    - `@hot-updater/server` publishes `dist` only.
    - `@hot-updater/cloudflare`, `@hot-updater/supabase`, and `@hot-updater/react-native` leave their specs out of the source they ship.
    - `@hot-updater/react-native` also leaves out its Android unit tests.
    - `@hot-updater/cloudflare`'s D1 test database moves to `@hot-updater/test-utils/node`.
  - `@hot-updater/postgres` and `@hot-updater/console` import the storage engine kit and the plugin types from `@hot-updater/plugin-core`.

### Patch Changes

- 4d15862: `@hot-updater/core` is renamed `@hot-updater/protocol`: the device-safe, zero-dependency package for what crosses a boundary, the formats and pure computations the app and the server share and the contracts between a host and its extensions on the device, such as the client plugin contract. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` is the kit that extends the server, with the adapter and server plugin contracts and their helpers: it runs wherever the server runs, and the app never imports it.
  - Import from `@hot-updater/protocol` where you imported `@hot-updater/core`. Every Hot Updater package that depended on `@hot-updater/core` depends on `@hot-updater/protocol` instead. `@hot-updater/core` stays on npm for 0.x.
  - `canonicalizeAppVersion` moves to `@hot-updater/protocol`, which bundles the version parsing it uses and has no dependencies. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` exports it as before.
  - `@hot-updater/react-native` no longer depends on `@hot-updater/plugin-core`: the app imports `@hot-updater/protocol` and the built-in Insights client, never `@hot-updater/plugin-core` or `@hot-updater/server`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-insights` takes `@hot-updater/plugin-core` as an optional peer dependency, which only its `./server` entry needs, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys` as a peer dependency, so an app that installs `@hot-updater/react-native` no longer installs `@hot-updater/plugin-core`. A server gets it through `@hot-updater/server`.
  - Third-party server plugins and storage, build, and signing adapters import `@hot-updater/plugin-core` and list it in `peerDependencies`; client plugins do the same with `@hot-updater/protocol`. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` now also exports `addDistinct`, `countDistinct`, and `mergeDistinct`, so a plugin imports everything it needs from its root.
  - Client plugins import `defineClientPlugin` and its types from `@hot-updater/protocol`. `@hot-updater/react-native` still exports them for app code.
  - The `@hot-updater/react-native/plugins/insights` subpath is removed: import `insights` and its types from `@hot-updater/react-native`, as in `import { HotUpdater, insights } from "@hot-updater/react-native"`. Metro bundles the Insights client into every app, about 4 KB gzipped; it reports nothing until the app adds it to `plugins`. `hot-updater init` and the agent scaffold print that import, and `hot-updater doctor` looks for it.
  - `@hot-updater/protocol` exports the plugin host the SDK runs client plugins on, for any device SDK to reuse: `createPluginHost`, `pluginStorageKey`, `resolveBaseURL`, `HotUpdaterBaseURL`, and the `PluginHost*` types. `@hot-updater/react-native` has no subpaths, and `@hot-updater/test-utils/react-native` runs client plugins on protocol's host, without `@hot-updater/react-native` as a peer dependency.
  - `@hot-updater/cli-tools` adds `renderAppImports`, which groups the app's imports by module.
  - The `@hot-updater/plugin-core` root exports `definePlugin`, the schema DSL, the typed database handle, and the database errors.
