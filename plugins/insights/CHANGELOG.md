### Minor Changes

- f185d6d: Insights and API keys ship as their own packages: `@hot-updater/plugin-insights`, with `./server` and `./client`, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys`, with `./server`. `@hot-updater/server` and `@hot-updater/react-native` depend on them: the server re-exports them from `@hot-updater/server/plugins/insights` and `@hot-updater/server/plugins/api-keys`, and the app SDK exports the Insights client from its root, so servers and apps install nothing more.
- 61fcd51: `@hot-updater/server` is the runtime host: its root holds `createHotUpdater`, its types, the handlers and `toNodeHandler`, and its other entries are the built-in adapters (`./adapters/*`) and plugins (`./plugins/insights`, `./plugins/api-keys`). The storage engine, the database adapter kit, and core's schema move to `@hot-updater/plugin-core`, the kit adapters and plugins build on, and test code moves to `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
  - `@hot-updater/server/database`, `@hot-updater/server/node`, `@hot-updater/server/plugins`, and `@hot-updater/server/plugins/insights/testing` are removed:
    - Import from `@hot-updater/plugin-core` what you imported from `@hot-updater/server/database` or `@hot-updater/server/plugins`.
    - Import `toNodeHandler` from `@hot-updater/server`.
    - Import the Insights suites from `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
  - From `@hot-updater/server/db`:
    - `createMeasuredDatabase`, `MeasuredDatabase`, and `MeasuredDatabaseOptions` move to `@hot-updater/test-utils`.
    - `targetBaseCandidateKey` and `EngineSqlOptions` move to `@hot-updater/plugin-core`, beside `parseBaseCandidateKey`.
    - `settingsStatements` is private.
  - `createEngine` now has the signature `createEngine(database, { plugins, now })`. It takes a database as `createEngineDatabase` returns it, and returns `{ core, database(plugin), flush, dispose }`. rc.18's `createEngine({ adapter, schema, maxPageSize, verify, retry })` from `@hot-updater/server/database` is gone. A transaction's retries are the database's `retry` (`createEngineDatabase({ retry })`), and verify mode is `verifyAdapter(adapter)`.
  - These rc.18 names now exist in no package, because they are the storage engine's internals:
    - `aggregateBatchingModule`, `CheckIndex`, `checkSchemaFence`, `classifySqlError`, `CliFor`, `compareTuples`, `createDatabaseEngine`;
    - `DATABASE_MAX_MULTI_VALUES`, `DATABASE_MAX_QUERY_LIMIT`, `DatabaseEngine`, `DatabaseEngineOptions`, `DatabaseTestState`, `DatabaseValueError`;
    - `ENGINE_SCHEMA_KEY`, `ENGINE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `InstanceFor`, `isMissingSchemaError`, `MAX_SHARDS`, `migrateSchema`, `normalizeStoredValue`;
    - `ReadRange`, `ResolvedReference`, `resolveSchema`, `SchemaModule`, `settingsStatements`, `SHARD_COLUMN`, `validateSchema`, `withSchemaFence`.
  - No package has an internal entry: `@hot-updater/plugin-core/internal`, `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/internal`, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys/internal` are removed, and `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/testing` too. A package uses another only through its public API. `InsightsBadRequestError`, which Insights' API throws for an input it refuses, is exported from `@hot-updater/plugin-insights/server`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-core` exports `createEngine(database, { plugins, now })`, the storage engine as `createHotUpdater` runs it: core's tables and the plugins', the plugins' settings rows behind the schema fence, expired rows pruned during writes, and batched aggregates. `meterReads(database)` meters any database on the engine, a provider's included, for adapter cost analysis. `database.measureReads(read)` reports what a call read at the adapter and at the engine. Aggregate batching's compaction and flush reads during the call count.
  - An `EngineDatabase` takes an optional `retry`, which `createEngineDatabase` also takes: how a transaction that conflicts with another write runs again, with `onRetry` to observe each rerun. A store many writers contend on can take more attempts.
  - `MemoryAdapterOptions` keeps only `tablePrefix`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-core` also exports what an adapter, a provider's tooling, or a plugin outside it needs: `SETTINGS_TABLE`, `aggregateBatchingTables`, and `encodeKvKey` for setups and access policies; `createEngineSqlMigrator`, `createSettingsMigrator`, `sqlTableShapes`, and `quoteSql` for ORM adapters; `DATABASE_VERSION_COLUMN`, `rowKey`, `findPhysicalIndex`, and `findPhysicalColumn` for an adapter that is neither SQL nor key-value; `compareUtf8` and `isDatabaseJsonObject` for plugins; the types `verifyAdapter` returns and throws; and the option and tooling types of its public functions. `createEngineDatabase` takes `readSettings` for an adapter that reads stored settings itself.
  - `CoreSchema`, core's tables as `createEngine`'s `core` handle types them, is part of `@hot-updater/plugin-core`'s API: a change to core's schema releases `@hot-updater/plugin-core` and ships with the migration `schema.core` versions.
  - `@hot-updater/test-utils` uses the other packages only through their public API. `createMeasuredDatabase(adapter, plugins, { now, storage })` returns a promise of core, the plugins' APIs, their `clientAuth`, and `measureReads`, from `createHotUpdater` over `meterReads({ name, adapter: verifyAdapter(adapter) })`; `now` is the plugins' clock. `setupReadBudgetTestSuite` takes no `server`, and its `createAdapter` gets `SETTINGS_TABLE` among its `tables`. `createPluginTestHarness` and `setupAggregateBatchingTestSuite` run on `createEngine` and take no `engine`; the harness runs no retention passes. It also exports `createMemoryKeyValueStore`, the database fixtures, and the Insights suites, and `@hot-updater/test-utils/node` the SQL test executors and `createD1TestDatabase(db, statements)`, a D1 database over `node:sqlite`. `@hot-updater/server` and `@hot-updater/plugin-insights` are optional peer dependencies.
  - Published packages leave out specs and test helpers:
    - `@hot-updater/server` publishes `dist` only.
    - `@hot-updater/cloudflare`, `@hot-updater/supabase`, and `@hot-updater/react-native` leave their specs out of the source they ship.
    - `@hot-updater/react-native` also leaves out its Android unit tests.
    - `@hot-updater/cloudflare`'s D1 test database moves to `@hot-updater/test-utils/node`.
  - `@hot-updater/postgres` and `@hot-updater/console` import the storage engine kit and the plugin types from `@hot-updater/plugin-core`.

### Patch Changes

- 4d15862: `@hot-updater/core` is renamed `@hot-updater/protocol`: the device-safe, zero-dependency package for what crosses a boundary, the formats and pure computations the app and the server share and the contracts between a host and its extensions on the device, such as the client plugin contract. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` is the kit that extends the server, with the adapter and server plugin contracts and their helpers: it runs wherever the server runs, and the app never imports it.
  - Import from `@hot-updater/protocol` where you imported `@hot-updater/core`. Every Hot Updater package that depended on `@hot-updater/core` depends on `@hot-updater/protocol` instead. `@hot-updater/core` stays on npm for 0.x.
  - `canonicalizeAppVersion` moves to `@hot-updater/protocol`, which bundles the version parsing it uses and has no dependencies. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` exports it as before.
  - `@hot-updater/react-native` no longer depends on `@hot-updater/plugin-core`: the app imports `@hot-updater/protocol` and the built-in Insights client, never `@hot-updater/plugin-core` or `@hot-updater/server`.
  - `@hot-updater/plugin-insights` takes `@hot-updater/plugin-core` as an optional peer dependency, which only its `./server` entry needs, and `@hot-updater/plugin-api-keys` as a peer dependency, so an app that installs `@hot-updater/react-native` no longer installs `@hot-updater/plugin-core`. A server gets it through `@hot-updater/server`.
  - Third-party server plugins and storage, build, and signing adapters import `@hot-updater/plugin-core` and list it in `peerDependencies`; client plugins do the same with `@hot-updater/protocol`. `@hot-updater/plugin-core` now also exports `addDistinct`, `countDistinct`, and `mergeDistinct`, so a plugin imports everything it needs from its root.
  - Client plugins import `defineClientPlugin` and its types from `@hot-updater/protocol`. `@hot-updater/react-native` still exports them for app code.
  - The `@hot-updater/react-native/plugins/insights` subpath is removed: import `insights` and its types from `@hot-updater/react-native`, as in `import { HotUpdater, insights } from "@hot-updater/react-native"`. Metro bundles the Insights client into every app, about 4 KB gzipped; it reports nothing until the app adds it to `plugins`. `hot-updater init` and the agent scaffold print that import, and `hot-updater doctor` looks for it.
  - `@hot-updater/protocol` exports the plugin host the SDK runs client plugins on, for any device SDK to reuse: `createPluginHost`, `pluginStorageKey`, `resolveBaseURL`, `HotUpdaterBaseURL`, and the `PluginHost*` types. `@hot-updater/react-native` has no subpaths, and `@hot-updater/test-utils/react-native` runs client plugins on protocol's host, without `@hot-updater/react-native` as a peer dependency.
  - `@hot-updater/cli-tools` adds `renderAppImports`, which groups the app's imports by module.
  - The `@hot-updater/plugin-core` root exports `definePlugin`, the schema DSL, the typed database handle, and the database errors.
