# How does it work?

`hot-updater` is a system designed for dynamically updating JavaScript bundles in native applications. It operates using the following components and procedures:

### UUIDv7 to Timestamp Playground

Enter a Bundle ID to determine its deployment time:

<input type="text" placeholder="Bundle ID" style={{ width: '100%' }} onChange={(e) => {
  const value = e.target.value;
  
  try {
    if (/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-7[0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i.test(value)) {
      const hex = value.replace(/-/g, '').substring(0, 12);
      const timestamp = parseInt(hex, 16);
      const date = new Date(timestamp);
      
      // Display result
      document.getElementById('timestamp-result').textContent =
        `Bundle deployed at: ${date.toLocaleString()}`;
    } else {
      document.getElementById('timestamp-result').textContent =
        'Invalid UUIDv7 format.';
    }
  } catch (error) {
    document.getElementById('timestamp-result').textContent =
      'An error occurred while extracting the timestamp.';
  }
}}/>

<div id="timestamp-result" style={{ marginTop: '10px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}></div>

## Core Infrastructure

`hot-updater` consists of three key components:

- **Storage**: A place where JavaScript bundles are stored, supporting AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Supabase Storage, Firebase Storage, etc.
- **Database**: Stores metadata about deployed bundles (version information, etc.) and manages update information.
- **Server**: Determines whether updates are required based on the app's current state, operating through AWS Lambda@Edge, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase Edge Functions, or Firebase Cloud Functions.

Storage and Database are configured using plugins defined in `hot-updater.config.ts`. The Server is initialized and deployed using the `hot-updater init` command.

## Update Decision Logic

`hot-updater` primarily uses UUIDv7 for its operations, with the following update determination process:

### 1. Bundle ID Generation and Management
- Running `hot-updater deploy` invokes a Babel plugin to generate a UUIDv7-formatted Bundle ID.
- This Bundle ID includes the deployment timestamp and is uniquely generated per bundle.

### 2. Initial Native App Build
- The first version of the native app does not have an initial Bundle ID, as it isn't created by `hot-updater deploy` but by the native build process.
- In this case, a minimal Bundle ID (`minBundleId`) in UUIDv7 format, based on the app build timestamp, is used.

### 3. Communication with the Update Server
- The app communicates with the server using the current Bundle ID to verify if the bundle is activated (`enabled=true`).
- If the bundle isn't active, the app forcibly updates (rollbacks) to a previously active bundle.
- If an active bundle newer than the current app version exists, the app updates to the latest available bundle.

### 4. Usage of minBundleId
- The `minBundleId` is determined based on the native app's build timestamp.
- The existence of a native app build ensures the embedded bundle is the latest at that point. Bundles older than the `minBundleId` are ignored.
- Every new deployment generates a new Bundle ID, ensuring accurate and reliable updates.
