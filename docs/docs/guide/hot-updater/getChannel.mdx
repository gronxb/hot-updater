# `HotUpdater.getChannel()`

The `HotUpdater.getChannel()` function retrieves the current release channel of the app. This is useful when you want to determine which channel updates are being applied from.

By default, if no channel is specified, the app is assigned to the `production` channel.

## Usage

You can use `HotUpdater.getChannel()` to dynamically check the release channel in your application logic.

### Example

```tsx
import { HotUpdater } from "@hot-updater/react-native";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

function App() {
  const channel = HotUpdater.getChannel();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Current Channel: {channel}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default HotUpdater.wrap({
  source: "<your-update-server-url>",
  requestHeaders: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-access-token>",
  },
})(App);
```

## Behavior

- If `releaseChannel` is set in `hot-updater.config.ts`, `HotUpdater.getChannel()` returns that value.
- If no channel is set, the default is `production`.
- Channels help separate environments such as `dev`, `staging`, and `production`, ensuring that updates are applied correctly.
- When building a native app, the initial channel is determined based on the `releaseChannel` specified in `hot-updater.config.ts`.
- After the app is built, updates can be deployed to the correct channel using `hot-updater deploy -c <channel>`, such as `hot-updater deploy -c production` or `hot-updater deploy -c dev`.
- **It is crucial to set the correct channel during the initial build**, as the app will continue to receive updates only from that specified channel.

## Configuration Example (`hot-updater.config.ts`)

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";
import "dotenv/config";

export default defineConfig({
  releaseChannel: "dev", // Specifying the release channel
  build: ...,
  storage: ...,
  database: ...,
});
```

With this configuration, `HotUpdater.getChannel()` will return `"dev"`. This ensures that all future updates are correctly applied to the `dev` channel.
