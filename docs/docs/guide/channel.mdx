# Channels

Channels help manage updates across different environments (development, staging, production) and deliver updates to specific user groups.

The concept of channels isn't limited to environments alone but also facilitates app separation. For instance, if you're managing multiple apps (e.g., app2, app3, app4), each can utilize a distinct channel.

## Channel Overview

- **Default Channel**: If no channel is specified, apps default to the `production` channel.
- **Environment Management**: Channels clearly separate different environments (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) to ensure updates are applied accurately.
- **Initial Channel Setup**: When building a native app, the initial channel is determined by the `releaseChannel` specified in the configuration file (`hot-updater.config.ts`).

## Setting Up Channels

### 1. Specify Channel in Configuration File

It's important to set the initial channel explicitly using the `releaseChannel` property within your `hot-updater.config.ts` file:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";
import "dotenv/config";

export default defineConfig({
  releaseChannel: "dev", // Set your desired release channel
  build: ...,             // Other configurations
  storage: ...,
  database: ...,
});
```

### 2. Specify Channel via Command Line

Alternatively, specify the channel directly when running deployment commands:

<PackageManagerTabs command={
  {
    npm: "npx hot-updater deploy -p <\"ios\" | \"android\"> -t \"1.x.x\" -c \"<channel>\"",
    pnpm: "pnpm hot-updater deploy -p <\"ios\" | \"android\"> -t \"1.x.x\" -c \"<channel>\"",
    yarn: "yarn hot-updater deploy -p <\"ios\" | \"android\"> -t \"1.x.x\" -c \"<channel>\"",
  }
} />


Replace `<channel>` with your target channel name (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`).

## Retrieving Current Channel

The `HotUpdater.getChannel()` function retrieves the current release channel within your app. This can help you dynamically verify the release channel and ensure your application logic aligns with the correct updates.

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { HotUpdater } from "@hot-updater/react-native";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

function App() {
  const channel = HotUpdater.getChannel();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Current Channel: {channel}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default HotUpdater.wrap({
  source: "<your-update-server-url>",
})(App);
```

## Behavior

- If `releaseChannel` is set in `hot-updater.config.ts`, `HotUpdater.getChannel()` returns that value.
- If no channel is set, the default is `production`.
- Returns `null` when the app is running in development mode.
- Channels help separate environments such as `dev`, `staging`, and `production`, ensuring that updates are applied correctly.
- The initial channel is injected into the native app during the build process based on the `releaseChannel` specified in `hot-updater.config.ts`.
- After the app is built, updates can be deployed to the correct channel using `hot-updater deploy -c <channel>`, such as `hot-updater deploy -c production` or `hot-updater deploy -c dev`.
- **Important**: Channel changes require rebuilding the native app to take effect. Simply changing the channel in the configuration file or through deployment commands will not update the channel of an already built app.
- **It is crucial to set the correct channel during the initial build**, as the app will continue to receive updates only from that specified channel.
