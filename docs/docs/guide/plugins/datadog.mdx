# Datadog Source Maps Plugin

The `withDatadog()` plugin for hot-updater enables automatic sourcemap upload to Datadog during the update bundle build process.

This helps you track production crashes with accurate stack traces tied to your React Native source code.

## Prerequisites

- Datadog Account: Sign up here if you don’t have one.
- Auth Token: Generate a token from your Datadog dashboard. This must be defined as the environment variable `DATADOG_API_KEY`.
- Datadog host: in order to communicate with Datadog, you need to specify the host to which the Auth token refers using the environment variable `DATADOG_HOST` (e.g., `DATADOG_HOST=datadoghq.eu`)
- Install the plugin:

<PackageManagerTabs command={
  {
    npm: "npm install @hot-updater/datadog-plugin --save-dev",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @hot-updater/datadog-plugin -D",
    yarn: "yarn add @hot-updater/datadog-plugin -D",
  }
} />

::: tip Stable execution
`withDatadog` internally uses `@datadog/datadog-ci` executed using `npx`. Although not required, you can install it as a `devDependency` to avoid unexpected HTTP calls failing during execution (e.g., in a CI environment). 
:::

## Step 1: Wrap Your Build Plugin

Use `withDatadog()` to wrap any compatible build plugin such as metro.

Once wrapped, sourcemaps will automatically be uploaded to Datadog when running the `hot-updater deploy` process.

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Metro">

```ts title="hot-updater.config.ts"
import { bare } from "@hot-updater/bare";
import { withDatadog } from "@hot-updater/datadog-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";
import "dotenv/config";

export default defineConfig({
  build: withDatadog(
    bare({
      enableHermes: false, // or true, depending if you want to use it
      sourcemap: true, // [!code ++] Required for sourcemap upload
    }),
    {
      buildNumber: "build number",       // [!code ++] The build number through which Datadog will sort the uploaded sourcemaps belonging to the same version
      releaseVersion: "release version",    // [!code ++] This is the release version that must match the release version used to stream logs from the app
      service: "service", // [!code ++] The datadog service to which the sourcemaps belong
    },
  ),
  // .. your other config
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Expo">

```ts title="hot-updater.config.ts"
import { withDatadog } from "@hot-updater/datadog-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";
import { expo } from "@hot-updater/expo";

export default defineConfig({
  build: withDatadog(
    expo({
      sourcemap: true, // [!code ++] Required for sourcemap upload
    }),
    {
      buildNumber: "build number",       // [!code ++] The build number through which Datadog will sort the uploaded sourcemaps belonging to the same version
      releaseVersion: "release version",    // [!code ++] This is the release version that must match the release version used to stream logs from the app
      service: "service", // [!code ++] The datadog service to which the sourcemaps belong
    },
  ),
  // .. your other config
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab label="RNEF">

```ts title="hot-updater.config.ts"
import { withDatadog } from "@hot-updater/datadog-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "hot-updater";
import { rnef } from "@hot-updater/rnef";

export default defineConfig({
  build: withDatadog(
    rnef({
      sourcemap: true, // [!code ++] Required for sourcemap upload
    }),
    {
      buildNumber: "build number",       // [!code ++] The build number through which Datadog will sort the uploaded sourcemaps belonging to the same version
      releaseVersion: "release version",    // [!code ++] This is the release version that must match the release version used to stream logs from the app
      service: "service", // [!code ++] The datadog service to which the sourcemaps belong
    },
  ),
  // .. your other config
});
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

::: tip Automatic Upload
When `withDatadog()` wraps your build plugin, all generated sourcemaps are uploaded to Datadog automatically during the `hot-updater deploy` process.
:::

## Step 3: Deploy

Now, every time you deploy, sourcemaps will be automatically uploaded to Datadog.

<PackageManagerTabs command={
  {
    npm: "npx hot-updater deploy -i",
    pnpm: "pnpm hot-updater deploy -i",
    yarn: "yarn hot-updater deploy -i",
  }
} />
