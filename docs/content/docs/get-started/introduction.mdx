## What is Hot Updater?

Hot Updater is a self-hostable OTA (Over-The-Air) update solution for React Native apps. Deploy JavaScript bundle updates instantly without going through app stores.

## Why Hot Updater?

CodePush depended on Microsoft's AppCenter, which had limitations:
- No CDN support, causing slow downloads in some regions
- Only supports Metro bundler, excluding newer alternatives like Re.Pack
- AppCenter has been discontinued

Hot Updater solves these problems with two core principles:

**1. Deploy Anywhere**
Use any infrastructure you want - AWS, Cloudflare, Supabase, Firebase, or your own servers.

**2. Use Any Bundler**
Works with Metro, Re.Pack or any bundler through the plugin system.

## How It Works

Hot Updater uses a [Plugin System](../concepts/plugin-system) that separates concerns:
- **Build Plugins**: Handle bundling (Metro, Re.Pack, Expo, Rock)
- **Storage Plugins**: Store bundles anywhere (S3, R2, Supabase, Firebase)
- **Database Plugins**: Manage metadata (PostgreSQL, D1, Firestore)

This architecture gives you complete control over your deployment infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosting**: Full control over your update infrastructure
- **Multi-Platform**: Seamless iOS and Android support
- **Web Console**: Intuitive update management interface
- **Version Control**: Robust versioning with semantic versioning support
- **Forced Updates**: Push critical updates when needed
- **Channel Management**: Separate environments (dev, staging, production)
- **Fingerprint Strategy**: Automatic native compatibility checking
